About
======
> a very simple, tiny and intuitive ffmpeg wrapper with a cli interface for inspecting & transforming media files supported by the original ffmpeg software.

Why
===
> I wanted to learn more about ffmpeg and dig deep into its use cases, so I tried to build a simple wrapper that is consdered a shortcut for ffmpeg.

Features
========
- [x] Inspecting a video file to get its info including (duration, size, thumbnail, ... etc).
- [x] Transforming a video file (converting, resizing and compressing).
- [ ] Generating a HLS playlist from a video file.
- [ ] Supporting S3 as a valid file source/output beside the currently and only supported "local filesystem".
- [ ] Supporting FTP as a valid file source/output beside the currently and only supported "local filesystem".
- [ ] Supporting HTTP as a valid file source beside the currently and only supported "local filesystem".
- [ ] Implementing a "Distributed Queue" engine to simplify the integration with the real world problems/apps.
